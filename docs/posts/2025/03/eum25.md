# 10th EasyBuild User Meeting (EUM'25)

## Day 1 (25/03)

### Attendance 
Even with the challenge of having to reach the Jülich Supercomputing Center, the on-site seats for the event were fully booked a month before the event!

In person attendees had a first hour of meet and greet, everyone took merchandise to bring home. Once everybody chose a seat, the EUM was ready to start!

### Talks 

First day of talks was packed, starting with the usual EasyBuild State of the Union presentation.

Congratulating all contributors and mantainers, the big highlight surrounding this EUM is the release of **EasyBuild 5.0**! :tada: 

This was covered by the following talk given by Simon Branford (University of Birmingham), EB mantainer, explaining all the breaking changes, updates and new features. It is expected from now on to make a major release of EasyBuild every two years.

Some other crazy news from the EasyBuild community is the launch of a [swag shop](https://easybuild-eessi-shop.fourthwall.com/en-eur/)! All the profits generated by the shop will be destined to cover future events merchandise.

John Dey (Fred Hutch) and Bart Oldeman (Digital Research Alliance of Canada) gave their site talks illustrating the use of EasyBuild in their respective institutions, remarking some EasyUpdate status updates, new tools to build containers with EasyBuild, user tendencies, special software stacks and their site-specific systems. 

After lunch, a whole round of technical talks filled the afternoon. Starting with Alex Domingo (a.k.a lexming, EB mantainer as well, Vrije Universiteit Brussel) lecturing on Controlling the shell environment in EasyBuild v5.0, with some amazing improvements on how to handle environment variables and how they affect the modulefiles in this new release. Then, Jan André Reuter (JSC) gave tips and tricks on how to contribute (and not break) EasyBuild releases :^)

A friendly competition followed with the two presentations of Robert McLay (TACC - Lmod) and Xavier Delaruelle (CEA - Environment Modules), each one representing their own tools.

After the coffee break Alexander Grund (TU Dresden) started the session showcasing their development on secure workflows for shared HPC systems to handle sensitive data with minimal performance overhead. In the next talk, Jayesh Badwaik (JSC) addressed reproducibility challenges in continuous benchmarking within the early access program for the JUPITER supercomputer. 

Next one was Michael Klemm (AMD) presented an insightful talk about the AMD ROCm™ Platform, providing an overview of its open-source stack and how it enables high-performance computing with AMD Instinct™ accelerators.

Moving on another short break, two on-line talks closed the day. The first one introducing Open OnDemand, presented by the Ohio Supercomputing Center team. The second one was the Spack status update, given by the same Todd Gamblin, promising (again) that Spack v1.0 is about to launch, right for the ISC'25.

## Day 2 (26/03)

Second day started at 9AM sharp to the keynote of Jeff Hammond titled "Modern MPI and what you need to know about it", highlighting all the efforts in the MPI ABI standarization and modern developments in MPI. Definetly worth a re-watch [here](https://youtu.be/2-4ph2vryiw?list=PLhnGtSmEGEQi5xRViGJwLqZg3HMQJG0QM).

### Talks

Talks continued with Davide Grassano (CECAM) presenting A new LLVM toolchain for EasyBuild. Covering from how the compiler infrastructure works to a comparison of existing features and performance agains current GCC toolchain.

After the coffee break, Bart Oldeman lectured about the linear algebra infrastructure in EasyBuild's toolchains, how they work and how to squeeze them to get the best performance. Afterwards, Jens Henrik Göbbert (JSC) spoke about OpenGL support in EasyBuild, highlighting how libglvnd works to integrate OpenGL API calls altogether with different vendors. 

And we headed for lunch :spaghetti: Enjoying the sunny day at the JSC's cantine.

- does somebody have a pic? 

Once back, Brian Wylie (JSC) showcased about the POP CoE and their work. Closely related, Markus Geimer (JSC) introduced JSC's in-house tools to trace and do performance analysis of HPC applications. And Alexandre Strube (JSC) explored the State of LLMs in a funny and wonderful talk.

Closing presentations were the part two of the site-talks. Each one disclosing how they use EasyBuild in their institutions and discussing on some common problems, Caspar van Leeuwen (SURF), Bob Dröge (Universiteit Groningen), Cintia Willemyns (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Helena Vela Beltran (Do IT Now) had the honor to bring us to the social activity

Group picture was taken right before leaving. The sun made a special appearance for the last pics, making it very difficult to keep our eyes open.

### Social event

The karting competition, sponsored by Do IT Now, had place in the official [Michael Schumacher Kart & Event Center](https://www.ms-kartcenter.de/). Only 25 min away from the JSC.

Participants recieved a brief training on the procedures and safety as the track runs alongside real Formula 1 cars! :racing_car: :checkered_flag: 

They were split in 3 groups, each group would have to do a classification lap, then 15 minutes of real race. The 4 faster drivers from each group would make it to a final competition.

The groups that were not driving at the moment could have a lovely time enjoying the intense racing while having some drinks (don't drink and drive in any other situation!).

After a short break, four JSC researchers highlighted their work in their respective talks: Test infrastructure for EasyBuild by Sebastian Achilles, and Madita Willsch on "Quantum computing: JUNIQ & co". 

Continuing by the interesting Keynote by Damian Alvarez , ["JUPITER - State of the matters"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP8H16dfYs0&list=PLhnGtSmEGEQi5xRViGJwLqZg3HMQJG0QM&index=33), explaining all the process and decisions taken to make JUPITER a reality. From the tender procurement, crossing all the bumps in the road and all the work involved to the development point it is right now. 

![image](eum25_day3-09.webp)


The talks concluded with the heartwarming presentation by Bernd Mohr, titled ["Four decades of HPC"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKlDG48_b2A&list=PLhnGtSmEGEQi5xRViGJwLqZg3HMQJG0QM&index=34), where he explained from his experience the evolution of HPC systems when he started working on the field 40 years ago. He even brought some punch cards and old blades!

### Tour 

The day finished with a tour to the JSC and a visit (from outside) to the Exascale system in construction. Separated in 3 groups, the same JSC personnel attending EUM conducted it.

### Dinner 

The last sponsored dinner (also by INUITS/Microsoft/NVIDIA) took place in downtown Jülich. Everyone was sad to leave and exhausted after these intense days. Afterall, everybody left happy with some mugs and merchandise, and most importantly, lovely memories to take home.

A heartfelt thank you to everybody attending the EUM and to the sponsors, this year's event will be very difficult to top. :heart:
